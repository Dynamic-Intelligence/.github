# Dynamic Intelligence (Ψ)

We are a group of engineers, scientists, and roboticists from Harvard and MIT, building the data infrastructure for foundation models that power the robots of today and the physically-actuated devices of the future.

### Research Focus

**Human-to-Robot Transfer** — We create high-quality egocentric datasets that enable VLA models to learn manipulation skills from human demonstrations.

**6-DoF Pose Trajectories** — Full position and orientation tracking of hand movements at 30 FPS, compatible with LeRobot and other imitation learning frameworks.
